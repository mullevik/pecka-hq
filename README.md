# Pecka HQ
Front-end code snippets for GoogleSites pages of the HeadQuaters at camp Pecka. 

Html files contain scripts which comunicate with the backend API service that is implemented using Google App Scripts.

The purpose of this repository is to track the changes made in these code snippets, as maintaining them via the GoogleSites app isn't really possible.
